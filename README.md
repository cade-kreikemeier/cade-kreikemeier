### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the job search!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data structures and algorithms in JavaScript as well as React Router and Electron.
- ğŸ¥… My 2021 goals are to find a job in web development, have a working prototype of my proposed ERP Electron app, and be in good enough shape to do an entire mogul run without needing to take a break!
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he | him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I make a really, really good plate of spaghetti.
